The [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) game I would like to work on, based on [RanvierMUD](https://github.com/RanvierMUD/ranviermud) engine. With some master plan and great gameplay.

## What's here.

In this repository are only files from Ranvier's GitHub, that I changed somehow. So installing Ranvier and then copy-pasting my files to the main folder **should** give the thing that I have.

## Note to self:

- Apperently, the `look` command may show whatever I want. This is helpfull because I want players to know how each other look.
