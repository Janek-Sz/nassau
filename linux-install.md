Here are things I did on my Virtual Box. Saved in case I would need to install it again. *Which is highly possible.* It's kinda my notepad.

#### Things to install on the start:
```
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install npm

sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

And after all of this I should have
```
nodejs -v
v10.16.2
npm-v
6.10.3
```
.
